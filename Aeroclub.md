## **1. Should You Make an App or Just Store Data in the Cloud?**

**Short answer:** Both.

- **Cloud-based web app (primary):**
  - Accessible on any browser (PC, tablet, smartphone).
  - Easier for clubs to adopt (no installation).
  - Data is centralized, secure, and always up-to-date.
- **Mobile app (optional, later):**
  - For quick actions (booking flights, logging hours, checking invoices).
  - Could be Phase 2 after validating the product.

**Cloud hosting:**

- Use AWS / Azure / GCP (or DigitalOcean for lower costs).
- **Managed database (e.g., PostgreSQL)** for reliability.
- **Cloud storage** for documents (e.g., aircraft logs, licenses).
